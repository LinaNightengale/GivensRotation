### GivensRotation
This program approximates the experimental data with Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. 
This problem is reduced to solving an overdetermined system of linear equations by the Givens method. 
A text file with a discrete set of tests is fed to the program input. 
At the end, the user receives a text file with a set of points, they can be used to build the required approximating function in any suitable editor.
